Last time we talked about setting up a plex server, but where should we put all the media? Of course you can store your media on the same server that plex is running, but where's the fun in that?

1. You'll need a fresh install of Ubuntu 16+(Double check this)
2. Run this command **sudo apt install nfs-kernel-server** This will install the nfs package.
3.
